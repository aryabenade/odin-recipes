    <h2 class="head">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>1/2 cup urad dal</li>
        <li>1 pinches salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Refined oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parboiled Rice</li>
        <li>1 medium thinly sliced onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="head">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="text">
        <li><strong>Soak dal and rice</strong>
            <p>
                Soak urad dal and rice for a couple of hours and make a fine paste of the mixture by adding water, as per the requirement.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the mixture</strong>
            <p>
                Prepare the batter by adding a pinch of salt to taste and mix all the Ingredients well. Do not make the batter too thin
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Allow fermentation</strong>
            <p>
                Allow the mixture to ferment for about 6 to 7 hours. Once the batter rises and there is obvious fermentation which becomes imminent from the aroma of the batter.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Grease the tawa</strong>
            <p>
                Heat a non-stick flat tawa for 10 minutes on a low flame. Pour one tsp of oil on the tawa. Spread the oil evenly with a thinly sliced onion. Onion is used as a non-stick medium. But even on a non-stick tawa, it will only enhance the non-stickiness to the tawa.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle water</strong>
            <p>
                Sprinkle little water so that excess heat is absorbed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Spread some batter</strong>
            <p>
                Now, use a flat bottomed bowl and spread the batter on the tawa. Begin from the centre and go on spreading till you think it is even and has spread itself properly.   
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Let the dosa cook</strong>
            <p>
                Add oil through the dosa circumference so that it seeps in from all directions. Be patient especially if you want to make it on a low flame. And if you want to get it quick, increase the flame but not too high and be watchful of how much has been cooked.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Roll the dosa</strong>
            <p>
                As soon as you can spot golden colour through the sides and the middle of the dosa, take a flat ladle (or a wooden thin spatula) and instead of flipping it just roll it over from one end to the other.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve with sambhar and chutney</strong>
            <p>
                Serve hot with sambhar and chutney of your choice. Make sure you do try the recipe and let us know in the comments how you liked it.
